### ABOUT US

# Advocating for the Injured

We are an independent, non-partisan group of COVID-19 vaccine-injured individuals in the New Jersey, New York, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are advocating for acknowledgment of the COVID-19 vaccine injured, so that we can access essential healthcare, and gain access to vaccine injury compensation programs. We do not exist to debate the COVID-19 vaccine program. Science and compassion at the core of our work.

Member interviews have been featured in the *New York Times*, and *NewsNation*.
